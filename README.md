# Emirates_ARS
This project simulates an Airline Reservation System. This program is written in C++ and constitutes a basic graphical UI, created using graphics libraries provided by the language. The system works solely in SVGA256 graphics mode and displays images in bitmap (bmp) format. Also involves interaction through the use of mouse which is not common in C++ console applications.
