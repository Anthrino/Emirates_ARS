# Emirates_ARS
This project simulates an Airline Reservation System. This program is written in C++ and constitutes a basic graphical UI, created using graphics libraries provided by the language. The system works solely in SVGA256 graphics mode and displays images in bitmap (bmp) format. Also involves interaction through the use of mouse which is not common in C++ console applications.

* PLEASE REFER PROJECT_REPORT.docx FOR FLOWCHARTS, OUTPUT SCREENSHOTS AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS.
* EMIRATES.cpp contains source code for this project.
* (.bgi) files are essential for the VGA graphical execution environment of the program.
* (.bmp) files are the images being displayed in the program.
* CALCULATOR.cpp is an independent program (created as a prior 11th grade project) which simulates a Text based calculator-analyser written in C++.
